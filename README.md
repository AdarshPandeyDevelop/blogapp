Blog App â€“ Full Stack Node.js Application
Tech Stack: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, JWT, bcrypt, Multer, Tailwind CSS, EJS

Built a fully functional blogging platform from the ground up, focusing on clean UI, secure access, and smooth user experience. The application features user authentication with JWT-based route protection, ensuring that only verified users can access protected routes. Password security is handled using bcrypt to hash and safely store user credentials.

For user profiles, Multer was implemented to handle image uploads, allowing users to personalize their accounts with profile pictures. The app supports CRUD operations on blog posts with features such as post creation, editing, and deletion accessible only to the post owner.

A user-specific dashboard was created using Mongoose population to dynamically display user-related data, including authored posts. Additional features include a like system for user engagement and a responsive UI styled using Tailwind CSS and templated with EJS for dynamic rendering.

This project reflects a solid understanding of full stack development, including secure authentication, RESTful API design, middleware integration, and responsive frontend development.
